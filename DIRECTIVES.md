# DIRECTIVES — read by Claude Code at task start

## Directive 002 — Phase 0, test 13: lease expiry

In /home/nobara-user/CC-Wanderer:

1. Commit current state before changes (failsafe rule: always commit before any change).
2. Add acceptance test 13: lease expiry.
   - Lease length 3 seconds for this test only (do not change the 60s constant globally).
   - Wait out the expiry.
   - Confirm the holding host is DENIED after expiry.
   - Confirm the service can transition custody to a new host without a release from the expired holder.
3. Run the full acceptance suite (all 13).
4. Commit results.
5. Write the full test output and any deviations to REPORTS.md in this relay repo.

Scope ends there. Nothing else.

## Directive 003 — Relay watcher (after 002 completes)

Set up automatic relay polling on this machine:

1. Create /home/nobara-user/relay-watcher/watch.sh:
   - Every 5 minutes, git pull the wanderer-relay repo.
   - If DIRECTIVES.md changed since last execution (track last-seen commit hash in a state file), launch: claude -p "Read DIRECTIVES.md in the wanderer-relay repo and execute the newest directive per the established workflow. Commit results to REPORTS.md."
   - Log each run to /home/nobara-user/relay-watcher/watcher.log
2. Install as a systemd user timer (5 min interval), enabled and started.
3. Verify claude CLI headless mode works on this machine before wiring the timer; if it fails, report the failure instead of building around it.
4. Commit-before-change rule applies to all directives executed this way, always.
5. Report setup result and one full automated cycle test to REPORTS.md.

## Directive 004 — Automated cycle proof

This directive should be picked up by the watcher, not by manual invocation.
Append to REPORTS.md: "Directive 004 executed via watcher" plus the timestamp of execution.
Nothing else.

## Directive 004b — Retrigger

Directive 004 remains unexecuted. Execute it now: append to REPORTS.md "Directive 004 executed via watcher" with execution timestamp. Nothing else.

## Directive 005 — Expiry closes the epoch

Decisions from Lonnie on the two open questions from test 13:

Q1: Lease expiry closes the epoch immediately. The Wanderer must never sit in a stale epoch — an expired lease means the epoch transitions at that moment, holder becomes none, verifier reflects it. Implement this.

Q2: No cooling period, no re-lease restriction. Testing requires unrestricted lease/release/re-lease by the same hosts. Host-selection and hostage-prevention rules are Phase 1 product decisions — build nothing for them now.

Steps:
1. Commit before changes.
2. Implement Q1. Update affected acceptance tests.
3. Run full suite, all tests.
4. Commit, report results to REPORTS.md.

Scope ends there.
