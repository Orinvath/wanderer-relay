# DIRECTIVES — read by Claude Code at task start

## Directive 002 — Phase 0, test 13: lease expiry

In /home/nobara-user/CC-Wanderer:

1. Commit current state before changes (failsafe rule: always commit before any change).
2. Add acceptance test 13: lease expiry.
   - Lease length 3 seconds for this test only (do not change the 60s constant globally).
   - Wait out the expiry.
   - Confirm the holding host is DENIED after expiry.
   - Confirm the service can transition custody to a new host without a release from the expired holder.
3. Run the full acceptance suite (all 13).
4. Commit results.
5. Write the full test output and any deviations to REPORTS.md in this relay repo.

Scope ends there. Nothing else.

## Directive 003 — Relay watcher (after 002 completes)

Set up automatic relay polling on this machine:

1. Create /home/nobara-user/relay-watcher/watch.sh:
   - Every 5 minutes, git pull the wanderer-relay repo.
   - If DIRECTIVES.md changed since last execution (track last-seen commit hash in a state file), launch: claude -p "Read DIRECTIVES.md in the wanderer-relay repo and execute the newest directive per the established workflow. Commit results to REPORTS.md."
   - Log each run to /home/nobara-user/relay-watcher/watcher.log
2. Install as a systemd user timer (5 min interval), enabled and started.
3. Verify claude CLI headless mode works on this machine before wiring the timer; if it fails, report the failure instead of building around it.
4. Commit-before-change rule applies to all directives executed this way, always.
5. Report setup result and one full automated cycle test to REPORTS.md.

## Directive 004 — Automated cycle proof

This directive should be picked up by the watcher, not by manual invocation.
Append to REPORTS.md: "Directive 004 executed via watcher" plus the timestamp of execution.
Nothing else.

## Directive 004b — Retrigger

Directive 004 remains unexecuted. Execute it now: append to REPORTS.md "Directive 004 executed via watcher" with execution timestamp. Nothing else.

## Directive 005 — Expiry closes the epoch

Decisions from Lonnie on the two open questions from test 13:

Q1: Lease expiry closes the epoch immediately. The Wanderer must never sit in a stale epoch — an expired lease means the epoch transitions at that moment, holder becomes none, verifier reflects it. Implement this.

Q2: No cooling period, no re-lease restriction. Testing requires unrestricted lease/release/re-lease by the same hosts. Host-selection and hostage-prevention rules are Phase 1 product decisions — build nothing for them now.

Steps:
1. Commit before changes.
2. Implement Q1. Update affected acceptance tests.
3. Run full suite, all tests.
4. Commit, report results to REPORTS.md.

Scope ends there.

## Directive 006 — Release closes the epoch too

Lonnie's decision: the moment a host lets go — release or expiry, any reason — the epoch closes and their name comes off. An open epoch always names the actual current holder.

1. Commit before changes.
2. Implement for voluntary release, matching the expiry behavior.
3. Update affected tests, run full suite.
4. Commit, report to REPORTS.md.

Scope ends there.

## Directive 007 — Phase 1 begins: Custody

Phase 0 is complete. Proceed to Phase 1 per WANDERER_SPEC.md section 67:
accounts, passkeys, custody leasing, server-authoritative state, forced expiration, release, transfer, recovery. The Wanderer must survive hostile or disconnected hosts.

Per spec 66.17, custody and authentication changes require proposal before implementation:

1. Read the spec's Phase 1 requirements and all sections governing accounts, passkeys, custody, and recovery.
2. Write PHASE1_PLAN.md in CC-Wanderer: the components, how passkeys (WebAuthn) integrate with the existing lease/epoch model, what "hostile or disconnected host" scenarios must be survived, and the acceptance tests that will prove each.
3. Commit the plan. Copy its full text into REPORTS.md.
4. STOP. No implementation until the plan is approved.

## Directive 008 — Phase 1 plan approved, answers to all 8 questions

PHASE1_PLAN.md is approved. Answers, all approved by Lonnie:

1. Recovery: multi-passkey enrolment only; test authenticators for now. Real recovery routes are a pre-launch product decision.
2. Anonymity: passkey and nothing else. No email, no name. Identity policy decided later.
3. @simplewebauthn/server: approved.
4. Login surface: defer real browser ceremony to Phase 4. Phase 1 runs on the test authenticator; suite stays headless.
5. RP ID/origin: localhost. Production domain is Phase 7.
6. Operator: service-local administrative call, no remote surface.
7. Host numbers: per-Wanderer, allocated at lease, never reused. A returning account gets a new number. Confirmed.
8. No limit on Wanderers per account during testing. Product rule later.

Implement Phase 1 per the approved plan:
1. Commit before changes.
2. Build. Run the full acceptance suite (Phase 0 tests must stay green alongside the new Phase 1 tests).
3. Commit, report results and any deviations to REPORTS.md.

Scope: the approved plan only.

## Directive 009 — Watcher push fix, then Phase 2 plan

Part A — fix the silent failure:
The Phase 1 report committed locally but the push to the relay failed silently (status 0, nothing landed). Amend watch.sh: after committing to REPORTS.md, verify the push succeeded; on failure, retry once, then log the failure loudly to watcher.log. Keep a dated backup of watch.sh before editing.

Part B — Phase 2 plan (authenticity, per spec section 67):
Genesis registry, public verification, attestation chain, state fingerprints, Living Mark, lineage viewer. Success condition: W-001 independently distinguishable from a clone.

Per spec 66.17, this touches blockchain and signing — plan first:
1. Write PHASE2_PLAN.md: components, how EAS attestations map onto the existing epoch chain, what runs on-chain vs off, costs/testnet strategy, and the acceptance tests.
2. Commit, copy full text to REPORTS.md, verify the push landed.
3. STOP for approval before implementing.
