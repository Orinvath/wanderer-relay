## Directive 002 — Phase 0, test 13: lease expiry

In /home/nobara-user/CC-Wanderer:

1. Commit current state before changes (failsafe rule: always commit before any change).
2. Add acceptance test 13: lease expiry.
   - Lease length 3 seconds for this test only (do not change the 60s constant globally).
   - Wait out the expiry.
   - Confirm the holding host is DENIED after expiry.
   - Confirm the service can transition custody to a new host without a release from the expired holder.
3. Run the full acceptance suite (all 13).
4. Commit results.
5. Write the full test output and any deviations to REPORTS.md in this relay repo.

Scope ends there. Nothing else.
